# Geo-Guilder
This code allows to simulate Geolocation events about People walking, moving vehicles, airplane taxiing and taking off/ landing... or pretty much anything that moves and produces events!. There is also a html/javascript client to visualize events on a google map. This work is easily usable to represent geo events anywhere in the world

It can be used to: 
* simulate / generate geo location events
* publish (**liberate**) these events to a Solace Event Broker
* visualize these events on a Google Maps with moving icons
* enable **democratize** of geo location events to any applications with Solace Native Multi protocol capabilities 
* support polygons for fence detection to detect object entering a geographical 'zone' and **react** creating events back to the Solace broker
