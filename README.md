This code allows to simulate Geolocation events about People walking, moving vehicles, airplane taxiing and taking off/ landing... or pretty much anything that moves and produces events!. There is also a html/javascript client to visualize events on a google map. This work is easily usable to represent geo events anywhere in the world
